# Quick Start Implementation Guide

## Ready to Start? Let's Build Phase 1! 🚀

This guide will get you from zero to a working yt-dlp Docker container in about 2-3 hours.

## Prerequisites ✅

- Docker installed and running
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge
- Text editor (Cursor, VS Code, etc.)

## Implementation Order (Follow This Sequence!)

### Step 1: Create Project Structure (15 mins)
```bash
# We'll create these directories and files:
mkdir -p docker/scripts
mkdir -p examples  
mkdir -p scripts
touch requirements.txt
touch docker/alpine.Dockerfile
touch docker/scripts/entrypoint.sh
touch docker/scripts/healthcheck.sh
touch .gitignore
touch .dockerignore
touch docker-compose.yml
touch Makefile
touch VERSION
```

### Step 2: Essential Files First (30 mins)
**Order of Creation**:
1. `requirements.txt` ← Start here (defines what we're installing)
2. `.gitignore` ← Prevent committing unwanted files  
3. `.dockerignore` ← Optimize Docker builds
4. `VERSION` ← Version tracking

### Step 3: Core Docker Files (45 mins)
**Order of Creation**:
1. `docker/scripts/entrypoint.sh` ← How container starts
2. `docker/scripts/healthcheck.sh` ← Health monitoring
3. `docker/alpine.Dockerfile` ← The main Dockerfile

### Step 4: Build & Test Infrastructure (30 mins)
**Order of Creation**:
1. `Makefile` ← Easy build commands
2. `scripts/build.sh` ← Build automation
3. `scripts/test.sh` ← Testing automation
4. `docker-compose.yml` ← Easy container usage

### Step 5: Documentation (15 mins)
1. `README.md` ← Basic usage guide

### Step 6: First Build & Test (30 mins)
1. Build the image
2. Test basic functionality
3. Fix any issues
4. Celebrate! 🎉

## What We'll Build in Phase 1

### Minimal Viable Docker Container
- ✅ Based on Alpine Linux (small size)
- ✅ Non-root user (security)
- ✅ yt-dlp installed and working
- ✅ Volume mount for downloads
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Basic health checks
- ✅ Simple build/test scripts

### File Sizes We're Targeting
- **Final image size**: ~150-200MB (excellent for a media tool)
- **Total project files**: ~20-30 files
- **Lines of code**: ~300-400 lines total

## Expected Results After Phase 1

You'll be able to run commands like:

```bash
# Build the image
make build

# Download a video
docker run -v $(pwd)/downloads:/downloads yt-dlp:latest "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ"

# Use with custom format
docker run -e YTDL_FORMAT="best[height<=480]" -v $(pwd)/downloads:/downloads yt-dlp:latest "VIDEO_URL"

# Use with docker-compose
docker-compose run yt-dlp "VIDEO_URL"
```

## Debugging Tips

### If Build Fails:
1. Check Docker is running: `docker --version`
2. Check syntax in Dockerfile
3. Look at build logs carefully
4. Try building with `--no-cache` flag

### If Container Won't Start:
1. Check entrypoint.sh has execute permissions
2. Verify user/group creation in Dockerfile
3. Test entrypoint script separately

### If Downloads Don't Work:
1. Check volume mounts
2. Verify permissions on download directory
3. Test yt-dlp command directly in container

## Success Metrics

After Phase 1, you should have:
- [ ] Docker image builds successfully
- [ ] Container starts without errors  
- [ ] Can download a test video
- [ ] Downloads appear in mounted volume
- [ ] Health check passes
- [ ] Clean build/test process

## Ready to Start?

Let's begin with **Step 1: Project Structure**! 

Just say "Let's start!" and I'll guide you through creating each file in the optimal order. We'll build this step-by-step, testing as we go.

## Time Investment
- **Active coding**: 2-3 hours
- **Learning value**: High (Docker best practices)
- **Difficulty**: Beginner to Intermediate
- **Fun factor**: High (you'll have a working container!)

**Note**: This is Phase 1 only. We'll have a fully optimized, production-ready container with CI/CD by the end of Phase 3, but Phase 1 gets you something working that you can use immediately!
