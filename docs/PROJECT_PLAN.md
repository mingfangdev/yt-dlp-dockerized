# yt-dlp Docker Project Plan

## Overview
Building a comprehensive, production-ready yt-dlp Docker container following best practices.

## Project Goals
- ‚úÖ Lightweight, secure Docker container
- ‚úÖ Multi-architecture support (AMD64, ARM64)
- ‚úÖ Non-root user for security
- ‚úÖ Multi-stage builds for optimization
- ‚úÖ Automated CI/CD pipeline
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup ‚è≥
**Status**: Planning
**Goal**: Create basic project structure and simple Dockerfile

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create project directory structure
- [ ] Basic single-stage Dockerfile (Alpine)
- [ ] Requirements.txt with yt-dlp dependencies
- [ ] Basic entrypoint script
- [ ] Simple docker-compose.yml for testing
- [ ] Basic README

**Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours

### Phase 2: Production Optimization üìã
**Status**: Not Started
**Goal**: Implement production-ready features

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
- [ ] Non-root user implementation
- [ ] Health checks
- [ ] Proper logging and error handling
- [ ] Security hardening
- [ ] Environment variable configuration

**Estimated Time**: 3-4 hours

### Phase 3: Automation & CI/CD ü§ñ
**Status**: Not Started  
**Goal**: Set up automated builds and testing

**Tasks**:
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Automated dependency updates
- [ ] Multi-architecture builds
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Test automation
